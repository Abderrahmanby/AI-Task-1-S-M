# **Brief intro: -**
In this repository I'm submitting my first task in Smart methods training AI Department which is downloading ROS1 noetic on my computer and explaining the process and my experience with it.


# **Steps of installation: -**

## **First step: downloading Oracle Virtual Box:**
Virtual box is an app that allows the users to run almost any operating system without needing to fully install it as a new system, so I used it here to run ubuntu.

## **Second step: downloading ubuntu:**
Here I downloaded ubuntu 20.04 LTS and linked it to the virtual box to finally being able to use the system.

## **Third step: downloading ROS:**
Here I downloaded ROS1 noetic which is the version we will be working on in this training, I took the instructions from the official website: http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu

# **My experience with the installation process: -**
The installation was a bit challenging because of the lack of information, in the beginning I downloaded ubuntu 22.04 then after many tries I knew that this version does not support ROS and the packages were not found so I switched to ubuntu 20.04.

Overall my experience was good I learned more about Linux and ROS and also GitHub.
